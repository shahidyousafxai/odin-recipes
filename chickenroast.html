      <li>
        Remove the chicken giblets. Rinse the chicken inside and out. Remove any
        excess fat and leftover pin feathers and pat the outside dry. Liberally
        salt and pepper the inside of the chicken. Stuff the cavity with the
        bunch of thyme, both halves of lemon, and all the garlic. Brush the
        outside of the chicken with the butter and sprinkle again with salt and
        pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips
        under the body of the chicken. Place the onions, carrots, and fennel in
        a roasting pan. Toss with salt, pepper, 20 sprigs of thyme, and olive
        oil. Spread around the bottom of the roasting pan and place the chicken
        on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast the chicken for 1 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when
        you cut between a leg and thigh. Remove the chicken and vegetables to a
        platter and cover with aluminum foil for about 20 minutes. Slice the
        chicken onto a platter and serve it with the vegetables.
